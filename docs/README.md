[DEMO](https://passport-mern.Herokuapp.com/) on Heroku, the dyno may take up to 15 seconds on first reques, please be patient.

Node.js using the Express framework with a React client application using MySQL to log the user in with passport with the passport-local strategy using a username and password. Using bootstrap for basic UI with React-bootstrap

My intentions creating this repository was to learn passport, as well as create a good amount of _example code for others to help them create a successful user login system with mysql express react and node.js._
Not the Sequelize ORM that would take some modifications to setup.

## Getting Started

Currently to run the application you will need to:

- Clone the repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vincent440/passport-mern-sql.git
```

- Create a `.env` File and store all the database connection information,
  Or any other environment variables that will change depending on where the application is hosted.

Option 1

`echo`

Update the command with your specific environment and copy and run it to create a `.env` file with the key value pairs required to run the application.

```
echo PORT=3001 >> .env && echo DB_NAME=passportmern >> .env && echo DB_HOST=localhost >> .env && echo DB_USER=root >> .env && echo DB_PORT=3306 >> .env && echo DB_PW=<your password here> >> .env && echo MY_SECRET=your-most-secret-of-secrets-here >> .env
```

Option 2

create the `.env` file

```bash
touch .env
```

Then copy and paste the key values in and update them with your local config

```bash
# Port to host application on.
PORT=3001

# Name of the mysql database you will be connecting to.
DB_NAME='passportmern'

# Host name for connecting to MySQL database
DB_HOST='localhost'

#Port to connect to MySQL database
DB_PORT=3306

# User for connecting to MySQL database
DB_USER='root'

# Password for connecting to MySQL database
DB_PW='database-password'

# Secret for cookies/sessions
MY_SECRET='your-most-secret-of-secrets-here'

```

- Using `yarn` to pull in the required packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

If you do not have `yarn` you could use `npm`, but you'd need to update the scripts in the `package.json` file to reflect the usage of `npm` instead of `yarn`.

- Run the Database schema.sql to set up the database structure.

passport-mern-sql/config/[schema.sql](../config/schema.sql)

- Run the Database seeds.sql file

passport-mern-sql/config/[seeds.sql](../config/seeds.sql)

Then you should be all set to start making changes to the application.

### Hosting the application

In order to deploy this application:

you will need to ensure have a mysql database attached to your server. The way this application is set up the `.env` variables will need to match how the local database `.env` variables are set up.

I used Heroku to deploy my application.
to do the same you will need to:

- Have a Heroku account or create one.
- **assuming you have an account.** log in to the Heroku website.
- Create a new app and name it whatever you would like to match your applications initial Heroku url.
- Open `your application name` from the dashboard on Heroku's website and select `Deploy`
- Select `Github` and login to Github to connect your account to Heroku
- After succesfully connecting to Github connect the app to the github repository
  - Select the Github account you are using and search for the repository using the search box provided.
  - If you searched successfully you will see the repository you are looking for and have a _Connect_ button.
  - After pressing _Connect_ you have the option to either select a branch and setup automatic deployments or manually deploy whenever you want to test your latest build in a branch. up to you.
